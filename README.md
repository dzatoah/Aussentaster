ESP32 powered smarthome WiFi-Button with OTA support
====================================================

This sketch is a lightweight easy to use way of deploying self-built MQTT enabled WiFi-Buttons to your
smarthome! It is optimized for long-term battery usage so the ESP32 is almost 100% of the time in deepsleep,
which uses only very little energy to keep the RTC hardware going.

## Please adjust the credentials and settings in the `creds.h` file!

### To enable OTA/programming mode:
  - Hold down external button for 3 seconds. The lights should flash rapidly and after 3 seconds it should blink steadily.
  - You have 2 options to flash the new firmware over the air:

    - Arduino OTA (Arduino IDE and flash normally over network)
    - OTA via a middle-man-webserver which provides the OTA binary
      - `mosquitto_pub -h mosquitto -t "/ota" -m "<OTA_BINARY_URL>"`
      - `mktemp -d && python3 -m http.server # Copy the OTA bin hereâ€¦`
      - <OTA_BINARY_URL> is the IP address of your notebook in your local WiFi network.

### Sending MQTT messages if button was pressed
`<HOSTNAME>/button` sends `pressed` when external button got single pressed.

### TODOs / Ideas
  - [ ] Use https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager for a more comfortable deployment.
    - Can also ask for MQTT server settings.
    - Should be triggered when holding button for 15 seconds. (This should factory reset the device)
  - [ ] Add double click?
  - [x] Rename ino + build files
  - [ ] Fix/Test OTA over external webserver?!
  - [ ] Add documentation about integrating this into homeassistant
  - [x] Send battery level and software version over MQTT
